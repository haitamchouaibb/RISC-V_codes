# RISC-V Codes

Repository of exercises and projects in RISC-V Assembly for the **Computer Architecture** course at Politecnico di Torino.

## 📋 Description

This repository contains a collection of RISC-V Assembly programs developed as part of the Computer Architecture course. The exercises cover various aspects of Assembly programming, from array and matrix processing to compression algorithms.

## 🗂️ Contents

The repository includes the following programs:

- **RLEencode.s** - Implementation of the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression algorithm
- **Ricostruzione255.s** - Value reconstruction with saturation at 255
- **calcolaPrezzi.s** - Price calculation and processing
- **calcolaSequenza.s** - Numerical sequence processing
- **contaMaggiori.s** - Count elements greater than a threshold in an array
- **contaUguali.s** - Count occurrences of equal values
- **maxExcursion.s** - Calculate maximum excursion in a dataset
- **sommaMatrice.s** - Matrix sum operations
- **tempesta.s** - Storm data simulation or processing
- **trovaMax.s** - Find maximum value in an array
- **trovaModa.s** - Calculate mode (most frequent value) in a dataset

## 🔧 Requirements

To run these programs you need:

- A RISC-V simulator/emulator (e.g., RARS, VENUS, Spike)
- Basic knowledge of RISC-V architecture
- Familiarity with the RISC-V RV32I instruction set

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haitamchouaibb/RISC-V_codes.git
cd RISC-V_codes
```

2. Open the desired `.s` file with your preferred RISC-V simulator

3. Assemble and run the program following your development environment's instructions

## 📚 File Structure

Each `.s` file contains:
- `.data` section for variable and array declarations
- `.text` section with program code
- Explanatory comments (where present)
